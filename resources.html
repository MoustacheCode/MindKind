                                    Anxiety UK has evolved into a national organisation with an international reach
                                    while remaining run by and for those living with anxiety. Our small team of just
                                    four, is driven by personal experience, ensuring we truly understand the distress
                                    that anxiety can cause.

                                    In 2020, we celebrated our 50th anniversary with a commissioned painting by the
                                    artist Degard, that reflects our journey and commitment to alleviating anxiety’s
                                    impact. This artwork serves as a tribute to all who have shaped Anxiety UK into what

                                    Responsibility for improving the health of people in the UK must span all of
                                    society. A wide range of sectors and organisations have it within their power –
                                    including departments across national and local government, the voluntary sector,
                                    the private sector, media and local communities. By acknowledging and acting on
                                    this, it is possible to harness many opportunities to overcome the big health
                                    challenges of today.

                                    People with mental health problems aren't getting a fair deal. And it's especially
                                    hard for people from racialised communities, those of us in poverty, and young
                                    people.

                                    having access to the right information is vital.
